# The ELN Consortium
Electronic Lab-Notebooks (ELN) are a central database structure in research, academia and industry. 

## Goals
Define common specifications that allow the interchange of data and metadata between different ELNs. Items of interest are:
- exchange file formats
- common question schemata
- etc.

While we support open-software, we also acknowledge the proprietary solutions in the market. We invite all producers of ELN solutions to participate.

We work towards an inclusive community.

## History
The idea of this consortium was born during the [HIDA-funded](https://www.helmholtz-hida.de) stay of Nicolas Carpi at the [FZJ](https://www.fz-juelich.de) / [IEK-2](https://www.fz-juelich.de/iek/iek-2).
