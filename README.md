# The ELN Consortium
Electronic Lab-Notebooks (ELN) are a central database structure in research, academia and industry. 

## Goals
Define common specifications that allow the interchange of data between different ELNs. Items of interest are:
- exchange file formats
- common question schemata
- etc.
While we support open-software, we also acknowledge the proprietary solutions in the market.
